# Create README

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive README document for a code repository that explains the project structure and technical implementation to professional developers.

## Context

This prompt generates documentation for software projects, focusing on technical details that experienced developers need to understand and contribute to the codebase. The documentation should be thorough but accessible, highlighting interesting implementation details and architectural decisions.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the codebase structure and identify key components
2. Document the project's main functionality and purpose
3. Extract and document interesting technical techniques from the code
4. Identify non-obvious technologies and libraries used
5. Create a clear project structure breakdown
6. Include relevant links to documentation and external resources

For each section, provide:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the project's purpose and functionality
- **Technical Techniques**: List interesting implementation details with links to MDN documentation where applicable
- **Technologies**: Identify non-obvious libraries and tools used, with links to their documentation
- **Project Structure**: Directory breakdown with descriptions of key folders
- **File References**: Use relative links for files and directories mentioned

## Output Format

Generate a README document with these sections:

1. **Project Description** (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Technical Techniques** (bulleted list with MDN links)
3. **Technologies and Libraries** (bulleted list with external links)
4. **Project Structure** (code block with directory tree + descriptions)

Use straightforward, professional language without marketing jargon. Focus on technical accuracy and practical information for developers.

## Success Criteria

- README explains the project clearly to professional developers
- Technical details are accurate and well-documented
- All external links are functional and relevant
- Project structure is comprehensive and easy to navigate
- Code examples are properly formatted with markdown
- Language is direct and accessible without unnecessary complexity
