# Lean Strategy Canvas Builder

## Purpose

Create focused Lean Strategy Canvases for 12-18 month strategic planning by identifying clear goals, obstacles, strategies, and measurable objectives and key results (OKRs).

## Context

Product teams need strategic clarity to align on goals, understand challenges, and create actionable plans. This tool helps translate vague strategic intentions into concrete, measurable objectives with coherent strategies.


## Instructions

1. **Analyze input documents** containing:
   - Market research data
   - Competitive analysis
   - Business plans
   - Performance metrics
   - Prior strategic documents

2. **Define strategic goal:**
   - Establish overall 12-18 month objective
   - Determine if it's financial, growth, or expansion target
   - Ensure alignment with company's broader mission
   - Make goal specific, ambitious, and timebound

3. **Identify primary obstacle:**
   - Determine biggest challenge preventing goal achievement
   - Analyze competitive threats, organizational challenges, or technological factors
   - Focus on most critical obstacle, not all potential issues

4. **Formulate strategy:**
   - Create opinionated, coherent approach to address challenge
   - Define where to play (target audience or market segments)
   - Determine how to win (differentiation from competitors)
   - Establish policies and planned actions
   - Emphasize strategic choices, not just feature lists

5. **Create OKRs:**
   - Objectives: Qualitative, inspirational future states with clear value and timeboxing
   - Key Results: Aggressive, verifiable metrics that are outcome-focused
   - Format measures as "Who does what by how much?"
   - Ensure OKRs are ambitious yet achievable

6. **Validate strategic coherence:**
   - Goal is specific, ambitious, and timebound
   - Obstacle represents most critical challenge
   - Strategy involves difficult choices, not just actions
   - Strategy clearly states where to play and how to win
   - Objectives are qualitative and inspirational
   - Key results are quantitative and evidence-based
   - All elements connect and support each other
