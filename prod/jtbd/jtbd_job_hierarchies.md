# JTBD Job Hierarchies

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive job hierarchy for a specific product or service that shows how different jobs relate to each other at different abstraction levels.

## Context

Job hierarchies help stakeholders understand the strategic, tactical, and contextual relationships of jobs. They form the foundation for structured product development and prioritized roadmap planning.

## Instructions

Analyze the provided parameters and create a structured job hierarchy based on the following guidelines:

1. **Complete Analysis**: Examine users, product/service, focus, and context to understand the entire spectrum of jobs to be organized hierarchically.

2. **Structured Job Hierarchy with Three Levels**:
   
   a. **Strategic (High-Level) Jobs** (3-5 jobs):
      - Represent broad goals or missions that drive multiple tactical jobs
      - Align with long-term user goals and fundamental needs
      - Include: clear definition, core goals, important job steps
      
   b. **Tactical (Detailed) Jobs** (8-12 jobs):
      - Represent specific activities that contribute to strategic jobs
      - Focus on practical, everyday actions of users
      - Include: main goal, detailed job steps
      
   c. **Context-Specific Elements** (if relevant):
      - Scenario-specific variations of jobs
      - Target group-specific requirements
      - Environmental factors that influence job execution

3. **Hierarchy Principles**:
   - Express all jobs as verb + object + specification
   - Maintain logical parent-child relationships between levels
   - Follow MECE principle (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)
   - Focus on jobs that users want to achieve, not on product features

4. **Prioritized Strategic Goals**: Conclude with a prioritized list of the most important strategic goals, including brief justifications.

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"
