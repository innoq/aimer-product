# JTBD Forces Diagram

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive forces diagram to analyze the motivating and inhibiting forces that influence users' decisions to adopt a specific solution for completing a job.

## Context

A forces diagram examines four key forces: Push and Pull (positive forces) as well as Anxiety and Habit (negative forces). This analysis helps understand adoption barriers and develop strategies to promote solution acceptance.

## Instructions

1. Begin with a brief explanation of the goal: Understand what drives and inhibits adoption of the specific solution for the given job

2. Analyze the push forces of the current situation:
   - Identify 5-7 factors that make the current situation unsatisfactory for users
   - Focus on pain points, inefficiencies, and frustrations with existing alternatives
   - Describe each factor concisely but with sufficient detail to understand the impact

3. Analyze the pull forces of the new solution:
   - Identify 5-7 attractive aspects of the proposed solution
   - Focus on benefits, improvements, and desired outcomes
   - Describe how each aspect specifically addresses job requirements

4. Analyze the anxiety forces of the new solution:
   - Identify 5-7 concerns, uncertainties, or risks in adopting the new solution
   - Consider anxieties regarding performance, costs, learning curve, compatibility, etc.
   - Explain how each factor could delay or prevent adoption

5. Analyze the habit forces of the current situation:
   - Identify 5-7 elements of the status quo that create inertia
   - Focus on established routines, investments in current solutions, and comfort with familiar approaches
   - Describe how each element makes change difficult

6. Create recommendations to strengthen adoption:
   - Suggest 3-5 strategies to strengthen positive forces (Push and Pull)
   - Suggest 3-5 strategies to reduce negative forces (Anxiety and Habit)
   - Ensure recommendations are actionable and directly address the identified forces

7. Add contextual hints for implementation:
   - Provide brief guidance on how the forces diagram can be used for product development, marketing, or user research

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"
