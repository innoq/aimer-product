# JTBD Solution Approaches

## Purpose

Identification of essential activities and solution approaches for specific users in given scenarios that are practical, executable with software tools, and expressed in comprehensible language.

## Context

Solution approaches help understand the various ways users can complete specific steps in their job context. These approaches should be practice-oriented, software-supported, and comprehensible to end users.

## Instructions

1. Topic identification:
   - Establish 3-5 comprehensive topic areas that cover all possible approaches
   - Ensure topic areas are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE)
   - Consider the specific job context and steps to be completed

2. Solution approach generation:
   - Create the specified number of solution approaches that cover all topic areas
   - Each approach should:
     - Be executable with software tools
     - Be expressed in present tense
     - Use layperson-friendly terms from the user perspective
     - Avoid industry jargon for software categorization
     - Combine multiple topic areas if the number is low

3. Examples and topic assignment:
   - For each approach:
     - Add 2-3 examples in the format "e.g. Example1, Example2, Example3"
     - Assign relevant topic areas in square brackets at the end of the approach
     - If an approach covers multiple topic areas, separate them with commas

4. Output formatting:
   - Present results in a table with columns: | Category | Solution | Methodology |
   - The "Category" column should contain the generated approaches
   - Write these statements subsequently in past tense in an ordered list (after the table)

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language and correct gendering
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants" or "people"
- Use the gender asterisk (*) when gender-neutral formulations are not possible
- Examples: "user*s", "developer*s", "applicant*s"

## Output Format

**Topic Areas:** [Topic1], [Topic2], [Topic3], [...]

| Category | Solution | Methodology |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| [Solution Approach 1] | [Solution Description] | [Methodology/Examples] |
| [Solution Approach 2] | [Solution Description] | [Methodology/Examples] |
| [Solution Approach 3] | [Solution Description] | [Methodology/Examples] |

**Executed Solution Approaches:**

1. [Solution Approach 1 in past tense]
2. [Solution Approach 2 in past tense]
3. [Solution Approach 3 in past tense]

## Success Criteria

- 3-5 topic areas are identified and MECE-compliant
- All solution approaches are executable with software tools
- Approaches use layperson-friendly language
- Each approach has 2-3 examples and topic assignment
- Table and ordered list are correctly formatted
- Inclusive language is used throughout
- Output is saved in the correct path: docs/domain/jtbd/[job-name]/07-approaches.md
