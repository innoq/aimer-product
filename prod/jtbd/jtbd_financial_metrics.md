# JTBD Financial Metrics

## Purpose

Generate financial outcome statements for specific users evaluating products or services. These statements help companies understand the financial considerations of their customers in purchasing decisions.

## Context

Financial Desired Outcomes are structured as: [Improvement Direction] + [Metric] + [Control Object] + [Contextual Clarification]. These statements cover various customer journey phases and consider both direct costs and indirect KPIs.

## Instructions

1. Analyze job, context, and focus for the specified users
2. Brainstorm at least 10 potential topics (final topics should correspond to 30% of statements to be generated)
3. Evaluate the MECE principle for financial metrics in this job and context
4. Consider financial aspects across all customer journey phases:
   - Product selection
   - Product purchase
   - Product receipt
   - Product installation
   - Product disposal
   - Product upgrade
   - Learning product usage
   - Product maintenance
   - Product customization
   - Product storage
   - Product transport
   - Product replacement
   - Product configuration
   - Product integration
   - Product usage
   - Product repair
   - Product cleaning

5. Consider performance metrics (KPIs) that indirectly influence financial outcomes
6. Conduct analysis within <financial_analysis> tags:
   - Identify relevant KPIs for the job context
   - Develop potential control objects and contextual clarifications
   - Analyze how each consideration fits the job context

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"

## Output Format

Create a numbered list with the following structure:

**[Direction] the [Metric] of** [Control Object] _[contextual clarification]_

Example:
1. **Minimize the costs of** product maintenance _during the first two years of operation_
2. **Maximize the ROI of** technology investment _for the next budget period_

## Success Criteria

- All generated statements are relevant to the user role and job context
- Use of MECE principle for complete coverage without overlaps
