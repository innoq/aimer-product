# JTBD Job Personas

## Purpose

Creation of detailed job personas that represent archetypes of users based on their approach to completing specific jobs, rather than on demographic characteristics.

## Context

Job personas differ from traditional personas by focusing on how different users approach completing a job. They help understand various strategies, motivations, and barriers that influence job behavior.

## Instructions

1. Analyze job, context, and user group to identify different approaches to job completion:
   - Primary motivations and goals
   - Key priorities in job execution
   - Common barriers or pain points
   - Typical strategies and tools used
   - Risk tolerance and decision-making style

2. Create the specified number of different job personas (typically 3-5):
   - Use descriptive names that capture the job approach
   - Add a role description in parentheses that concisely characterizes the role
   - Differentiate by job approach, not by demographic or personality characteristics
   - Represent substantial user segments (avoid extreme edge cases)
   - Ensure that the main approaches to the job are covered

3. For each persona include:
   - **Primary Jobs**: 2-3 core jobs this persona attempts to complete
   - **Motivation**: 2-3 primary drivers that influence their job approach
   - **Barriers**: 2-3 key obstacles or concerns that can prevent successful job completion
   - **Characteristics**: 2-3 distinguishing characteristics of their job approach
   - **Typical Statements**: 2 representative quotes that illustrate their perspective

4. Ensure that the persona collection:
   - Includes the most important job approaches
   - Is MECE-compliant (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive)
   - Is based on job execution patterns, not arbitrary user characteristics
   - Is action-relevant for product development and design decisions

5. Conclude with a brief usage context paragraph that explains how these personas should be applied in product development decisions

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"
