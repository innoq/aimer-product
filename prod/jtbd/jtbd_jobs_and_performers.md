# JTBD Jobs and Performers

## Purpose

Identify and analyze the most important jobs and their performers in a specific domain. This analysis serves as the foundation for a comprehensive JTBD framework.

## Context

The identification of jobs and their performers is the first step in developing complete JTBD documentation. Use inclusive language throughout the analysis.

## Instructions

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"

### Analysis Steps

1. Analyze the specified domain, focus, and target market to identify important jobs that exist independently of current solutions. Consider:
   - Core functional needs
   - Emotional and social dimensions
   - Various usage contexts
   - Different stages of the user journey

2. Create for each job:
   - Precise job statement in the format: [Verb + Object + Specification]
   - Ensure the job statement is solution-independent (not tied to current products)
   - Focus on what users are trying to achieve, not how
   - Use action verbs in present tense
   - Avoid vague or subjective language

3. Identify for each job:
   - **Primary Performers**: Who typically performs this job (roles, not demographics)
   - **Frequency**: How often this job is typically performed
   - **Triggers**: Which situations or events trigger this job
   - **Success Criteria**: How performers evaluate successful job completion
   - **Current Alternatives**: How this job is currently accomplished
   - **Challenges**: Common difficulties in job execution

4. Organize jobs into 3-5 logical categories based on their relationship to each other or their role in the overall user journey.

5. Sort jobs within each category by priority, considering:
   - Importance to users
   - Frequency of execution
   - Current degree of dissatisfaction
   - Potential impact when improved
