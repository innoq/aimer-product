# JTBD Unmet Needs

## Purpose

Identification of unmet needs regarding specific Jobs-to-be-Done to support product innovation.

## Context

Unmet needs arise from gaps between what users want to achieve and what current solutions offer. The systematic identification of these needs forms the foundation for valuable product innovations and strategic development decisions.

## Instructions

1. Thoroughly analyze the job in the specified context:
   - Identify key steps in the job execution process
   - Recognize pain points that users likely experience
   - Evaluate current solutions and their limitations
   - Consider emotional and social dimensions

2. Synthesize Customer Outcome Statements and previous research to identify specific gaps:
   - Areas where current solutions underperform on important dimensions
   - Needs that remain completely unaddressed by existing options
   - Situations where users resort to workarounds or compromises

3. For each unmet need:
   - Create a meaningful, bold title that clearly communicates the need
   - Develop a 2-3 sentence explanation that elucidates the need, its context, and its significance for users
   - Ensure the explanation highlights the gap between desired and current state
   - Focus on the problem, not on potential solutions
   - Make it specific enough to inspire innovation, but broad enough to enable creative approaches

4. Prioritize needs based on:
   - Frequency (how often users experience this need)
   - Importance (how significant this need is for successful job completion)
   - Universality (how many users likely share this need)
   - Undersupply (how poorly current solutions address this need)

5. Ensure that the final collection of unmet needs:
   - Covers different phases of job execution
   - Includes both functional and emotional aspects
   - Represents diverse usage scenarios within the context
   - Is MECE-compliant (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive)

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"
