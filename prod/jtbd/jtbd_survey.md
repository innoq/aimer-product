# JTBD Survey

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive JTBD survey to collect insights about how users approach a specific job. This survey helps organizations understand customer priorities, pain points, and desired outcomes.

## Context

A complete JTBD survey consists of several sections: introduction, screening, job definition, current approach, outcome evaluation, pain points, demographic questions, and conclusion. The survey should take 10-15 minutes and cover both functional and emotional aspects of the job.

## Instructions

1. Develop a complete JTBD survey with the following sections:

   a) **Introduction**:
      - Create a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the survey
      - Indicate the estimated completion time (typically 10-15 minutes)
      - Ensure language is appropriate for the specified users and focus (B2B/B2C)
      - Include privacy and confidentiality statement

   b) **Screening Questions** (3-5 questions):
      - Design questions to verify if participants are suitable for the study
      - Ask about job experience, frequency, and relevance
      - Format as multiple choice or yes/no questions
      - Note which answers lead to disqualification

   c) **Job Definition and Context** (3-5 questions):
      - Create questions to understand how participants define the job
      - Ask about typical contexts, triggers, and frequencies
      - Use open questions for rich descriptions
      - Use a mix of multiple choice and open text fields

   d) **Current Approach** (5-7 questions):
      - Ask about current solutions, tools, or methods
      - Include questions about the selection process for current solutions
      - Explore satisfaction levels and switching considerations
      - Use a mix of multiple choice, Likert scales, and open questions

   e) **Importance and Satisfaction with Outcomes** (8-12 questions):
      - Create a matrix of outcome statements derived from the job
      - For each outcome, ask participants to rate:
        * Importance (1-5 scale from Not Important to Extremely Important)
        * Current Satisfaction (1-5 scale from Very Dissatisfied to Very Satisfied)
      - Ensure outcomes cover different aspects of job execution
      - Include both functional and emotional outcomes

   f) **Pain Points and Challenges** (3-5 questions):
      - Ask about specific difficulties in job execution
      - Include questions about frequency and severity of challenges
      - Explore workarounds and compensating behavior
      - Use a mix of multiple choice and open questions

   g) **Demographic/Firmographic Questions** (3-5 questions):
      - Include relevant demographic questions appropriate for the users and focus
      - For B2B: Questions about company size, industry, role, etc.
      - For B2C: Appropriate personal demographic data
      - Keep these questions brief and focused on factors relevant to job execution

   h) **Closing Questions** (2-3 questions):
      - Ask if participants are willing to participate in follow-up research
      - Include an open field for additional comments or insights
      - Thank participants for their time

2. Format Requirements:
   - Write all questions and instructions in the specified language
   - Keep questions clear, concise, and unambiguous
   - Avoid leading questions or biased language
   - Provide answer options for all closed questions
   - Include instructions for each section as needed
   - Number all questions sequentially

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language and correct gendering
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants" or "people"
- Use the gender asterisk (*) when gender-neutral formulations are not possible
- Examples: "user*s", "developer*s", "applicant*s"
