# JTBD Potential Jobs

## Purpose

Identify potential Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBDs) that a specific product enables for users.

## Context

Jobs-to-be-Done follow specific structures and verb categories. Functional jobs (approx. 80%) focus on practical tasks, while experiential jobs (approx. 20%) are oriented toward feelings and experiences. The MECE principle ensures that all relevant needs are covered.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the specified users and their likely needs, motivations, and contexts
2. Analyze the product, its features, and intended use
3. Apply the MECE principle to ensure JTBDs are unique and cover all relevant needs
4. Generate approximately 80% functional jobs and 20% experiential jobs
5. Use no adjectives or adverbs in job statements
6. Format each JTBD with a bold name followed by "The ability to..." and a detailed explanation
