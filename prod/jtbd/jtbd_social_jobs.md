# JTBD Social Jobs

## Purpose

Identification and analysis of social jobs that relate to perception by others during the completion of functional jobs.

## Context

Social jobs represent how users want to be perceived or not perceived by others while completing their functional jobs. This social dimension is crucial for understanding products and services used in social contexts.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the role, job, and context to identify relevant social perceptions:
   - Consider the social needs of the focused users
   - Account for the specific context of job completion
   - Understand the connection between functional and social aspects

2. Generate desired perceptions:
   - Create a complete list of positive perceptions that users want others to have
   - Begin each desired perception with "Be perceived as". Example: "Be perceived as competent"
   - Provide a brief explanation for each positive perception that connects it to the role, job, and context

3. Generate undesired perceptions:
   - Create a complete list of negative perceptions that should be avoided during job completion
   - Begin each undesired perception with "Avoid being perceived as". Example: "Avoid being perceived as incompetent"
   - Provide a brief explanation for each negative perception that connects it to the role, job, and context

4. Formatting rules:
   - Group titles should be bold formatted
   - Disregard context if none is provided
   - Output should be a numbered list
   - Use correct Markdown

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language throughout
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants", or "people"
- Avoid gendered assumptions and use inclusive terms for all roles
- Examples: "users", "developers", "applicants", "team members", "individuals"

## Output Format

1. Be perceived as [perception] - [Brief explanation connecting the perception to role, job, and context]

2. Avoid being perceived as [perception] - [Brief explanation connecting the perception to role, job, and context]
