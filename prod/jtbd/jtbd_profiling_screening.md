# JTBD Profiling and Screening

## Purpose

Develop complete screening and profiling questions for surveys to ensure that only qualified users participate in the survey and relevant demographic data is collected for marketing purposes.

## Context

Screening questions filter participants based on their relevance to the job and context. Profiling questions collect attributes that are important for marketing organizations and can be used for proportional sampling.

## Instructions

1. Develop screening questions to ensure that only users participate who:
   a) Regularly perform the job in context, or
   b) Have recently performed the job in context

2. Create a complete list of profiling questions that help understand the most common attributes of customers and consumers

3. Arrange screening questions so that questions that might lead to termination come before those that do not

4. Ensure profiling questions reflect the target audience (different consumer groups or corporate roles)

### Language Guidelines

- Use exclusively inclusive language and correct gendering
- Use gender-neutral formulations like "users", "applicants" or "people"
- Use the gender asterisk (*) when gender-neutral formulations are not possible
- Examples: "user*s", "developer*s", "applicant*s"
