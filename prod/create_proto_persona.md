# Create Proto Persona

## Purpose

Generate a proto persona based on Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) analysis that represents a key user segment and guides design decisions effectively.

## Context

Proto personas provide a preliminary user representation based on existing product requirements and research. They help teams align on user needs before conducting primary user research, following Nielsen Norman Group format for concise, actionable personas.

## Instructions

   - Review Product Requirements Document (PRD): docs/product/PRD.md
   - Examine Jobs to Be Done analysis: docs/domain/jtbd/
   - Check existing personas in docs/product/personas/ for consistency

2. **Create Proto Persona Structure**
   - Develop a realistic proto persona representing a key user segment
   - Focus on characteristics that directly impact product usage
   - Connect to specific requirements and features in the PRD
   - Align with jobs identified in the JTBD analysis

3. **Ensure Persona Quality**
   - Represent realistic user behaviors and needs, not stereotypes
   - Make immediately usable for design and prioritization decisions
   - Balance specificity with flexibility for product evolution
   - Format for single-page reference
