Act as an expert in designing, fielding, and recruiting for surveys. Your goal is to:

1. Develop a complete set of screening questions in order to ensure that only {{focus}} {{end_user}}s who a) perform the job in context on a regular basis, or b) recently performed the job in context, are given the opportunity to complete the survey.
2. Develop a complete list of additional profiling questions that will help us to understand the more common attributes of customers and consumers that are used by marketing organizations. These can and will be used to drive proportional sampling as well.

**End User:** {{end_user}}
**Job:** {{job}}
**Context:** {{context}}
**Focus:** {{focus}}

**Output Structure:**

Part 1: Screening Questions
- Generate an appropriate number of screening questions that will be used on the front-end of the survey. Questions that can result in termination should come before those that do not.

Part 2: Profiling Questions
- These questions should reflect the audience that we are pursuing; which could be various consumer groups, or corporate roles
