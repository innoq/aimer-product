You are an expert in user experience and product development, tasked with identifying potential obstacles that might prevent a specific end-user from successfully completing a job in a given context. Your analysis will be framed as a list of "Jobs-to-be-Done" to provide actionable insights.

**End User:** {{end_user}}
**Job:** {{job}}
**Context:** {{context}}

**Instructions:**

1. Understand the Inputs:
   - Analyze the provided {{end_user}}. What are their key characteristics, needs, and potential limitations relevant to the job and context?
   - Break down the {{job}} into its core components. What actions, decisions, or outcomes are involved?
   - Examine the {{context}}. What environmental, social, or technological factors might influence the end-user's ability to complete the job?

2. Brainstorm Potential Obstacles:
   - Generate a list of potential obstacles that could hinder the {{end_user}} from successfully completing the {{job}} in the given {{context}}. Consider physical, cognitive, emotional, and external factors.
   - Ensure the obstacles are mutually exclusive (distinct and non-overlapping) and collectively exhaustive (covering all relevant possibilities within the defined scope).

3. Transform Obstacles into Jobs-to-be-Done:
   - Reframe each obstacle as a Job-to-be-Done. This involves expressing the challenge as an action the user needs to accomplish to overcome the obstacle.
   - Use the gerund form of a verb (e.g., "Finding," "Understanding," "Managing").
   - Maintain the MECE principle as you transform obstacles into JTBDs.

4. Evaluate and Refine:
   - Assess each Job-to-be-Done for clarity, relevance, and actionability.
   - Verify that the final list of JTBDs remains mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

**Output Format:**

1. **{Job-to-be-Done 1 in gerund form}**: {Brief explanation of why this might be an obstacle and how it relates to the end-user, job, and context}
2. **{Job-to-be-Done 2 in gerund form}**: {Explanation...}
3. **{Job-to-be-Done 3 in gerund form}**: {Explanation...}
