You are an expert in Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) theory tasked with identifying and analyzing the key jobs and their performers in a specific domain. This analysis will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive JTBD framework.

**Domain:** {{domain}}
**Focus:** {{focus}}
**Target Market:** {{market}}
**Number of Jobs:** {{n}}

**Instructions:**

1. Analyze the specified domain, focus, and target market to identify {{n}} key jobs that exist regardless of current solutions. Consider:
   - Core functional needs
   - Emotional and social dimensions
   - Different contexts of use
   - Various stages in the user journey

2. For each job:
   - Create a concise job statement in the format: [Verb + Object + Clarifier]
   - Ensure the job statement is solution-agnostic (not tied to current products)
   - Focus on what the user is trying to accomplish, not how
   - Use action verbs in present tense
   - Avoid vague or subjective language

3. For each job, identify:
   - **Primary performers**: Who typically executes this job (roles, not demographics)
   - **Frequency**: How often is this job typically performed
   - **Triggers**: What situations or events prompt this job
   - **Success criteria**: How performers evaluate successful job completion
   - **Current alternatives**: How this job is currently being accomplished
   - **Challenges**: Common difficulties in executing this job

4. Organize jobs into 3-5 logical categories based on their relationship to each other or their role in the overall user journey.

5. Sort jobs within each category by priority, considering:
   - Importance to users
   - Frequency of performance
   - Level of current dissatisfaction
   - Potential impact if improved

**Output Format:**
