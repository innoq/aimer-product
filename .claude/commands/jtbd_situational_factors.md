You are an expert in job performance analysis and survey design. Your task is to generate a list of situational factors that could impact job performance for a specific end user. These factors will be used in a survey where respondents will rate each factor on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high).

**End User:** {{end_user}}
**Job:** {{job}}
**Context:** {{context}}
**Focus:** {{focus}}
**n:** {{n}}

**Instructions:**

1. Establish Themes: Create 3-5 comprehensive themes covering all job aspects. Add one theme for every 5 additional factors if {{n}} > 15.
2. Generate Situational Factors: Create {{n}} mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) situational factors relevant to the job, context, and focus. Frame factors as questions starting with "What is/was the level of..." or similar, focusing on external, variable conditions, not the user's skills. Avoid adjectives/adverbs at the beginning or within factor statements.
3. Group Factors by Theme: Assign each factor to one or more themes, maintaining balance. Combine multiple themes per factor for lower {{n}} values to ensure comprehensive coverage.
4. Format Output: Present results in the form of survey tables grouped by theme.

**Output Format:**

The situation will be rated by survey respondents on a scale of 1 through 5, where 1 will be the worst case and 5 being the best case.
