You are an AI agent tasked with creating a user story map based on Jeff Patton's methodology. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive map that provides both the "big picture" of the product and the detailed stories needed for implementation, using information from a Product Requirements Document (PRD), user journeys, and proto personas.

First, read and analyze the contents of the following files:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD):
<prd_path>
{{PRD_PATH}}
</prd_path>

2. User Journeys:
<user_journeys_path>
{{USER_JOURNEYS_PATH}}
</user_journeys_path>

3. Proto Personas:
<proto_personas_path>
{{PROTO_PERSONAS_PATH}}
</proto_personas_path>

Before creating a new user story map, check the output directory for existing user story maps:
<output_directory>
{{OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}}
</output_directory>

Review any existing .md or .csv user story map files in this directory to identify user stories that might be relevant to your current task. This will help avoid creating duplicate user stories across different maps.

After analyzing all documents and existing maps, create a user story map following these guidelines:

## Story Map Structure
1. Create a narrative flow that reads from left to right, showing the user's journey through the system
2. Organize the map in a clear hierarchical structure:
   - **Backbone (top row)**: Major user activities representing the big picture workflow
   - **Walking Skeleton (subsequent rows)**: Detailed user tasks and stories arranged vertically by priority
3. Ensure stories are organized to show both:
   - Horizontal narrative flow (what users do and in what order)
   - Vertical priority (most critical functionality at the top)

## Story Creation Process
1. Use the Sequential Thinking tool for breaking down user journeys:
   
   **When to use:**
   - When decomposing user journeys into backbone activities and detailed tasks
   - When establishing the narrative flow of the system
   - When determining the minimum viable product

   **How to apply:**
   - Start by identifying the major user activities that form the backbone
   - For each activity, identify the specific tasks users perform
   - Break tasks down into user stories that deliver specific value
   - Explicitly state "I will use Sequential Thinking to break down this journey"

2. Use simple story stubs in user story format: "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]"
3. Do not assign IDs to the stories
4. Draw a release line to separate:
   - Stories above the line: MVP (minimum viable product)
   - Stories below the line: Future releases
5. Identify any obvious gaps or missing functionality that would prevent a coherent user experience

## Output Formats

Create the user story map in two formats:

1. Markdown format that preserves the 2D structure:
```markdown
# User Story Map: [Journey Name]

## Backbone (User Activities)
Activity 1 → Activity 2 → Activity 3 → Activity 4

## Walking Skeleton (Tasks & Stories)

### Activity 1
- Task 1.1
  - As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome] [MVP]
  - As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome] [MVP]
- Task 1.2
  - As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome] [MVP]
  - As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome] [Future]

### Activity 2
- Task 2.1
  - As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome] [MVP]
...
```

2. CSV format for data processing:
```
User Activity,User Task,Story,Category
Activity 1,Task 1.1,"As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]",MVP
Activity 1,Task 1.1,"As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]",MVP
Activity 1,Task 1.2,"As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]",MVP
Activity 1,Task 1.2,"As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]",Future
```

Save both files in the following output directory:
<output_directory>
{{OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}}
</output_directory>

Name the files "user_story_map_[shortname of the journey].md" and "user_story_map_[shortname of the journey].csv" respectively.

## Final Analysis
After creating and saving the user story map, provide:
1. A brief summary of the map's structure and contents
2. The number of activities, tasks, and stories generated
3. Key insights gained from the mapping process
4. Recommendations for prioritization across releases
5. Identification of any potential gaps that should be addressed
