You are an expert in Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) theory tasked with creating success metrics for a specific job or job step.

**End User:** {{end_user}}
**Job:** {{job}}
**Context:** {{context}}
**Focus:** {{focus}}
**Number of CSS to generate:** {{n}}
**Step:** {{step}}
**Format:** {{format}}

**Instructions:**

1. Analyze the Job, Context, and Step (or lack thereof):
   - Understand what the {{focus}} {{end_user}} is trying to accomplish within the given {{context}}.
   - If a {{step}} is provided, focus on this specific part of the overall job.

2. Brainstorm Potential Themes:
   - Generate a wide range of possible themes for how success might be measured.
   - Consider at least 10 themes even if the final number will be reduced.

3. Evaluate Themes for MECE Compliance:
   - Ensure themes are Mutually Exclusive (distinct from each other).
   - Ensure themes are Collectively Exhaustive (cover all possible success measurements).

4. Establish Final Themes:
   - Refine the list into 3-5 final themes as the foundation for the CSS.

5. Generate Success Metrics (CSS):
   - Create {{n}} metrics, ensuring each belongs to one of the established themes.
   - About 20% should focus on avoiding negative outcomes.

6. Format According to Specified Style:
   - **PJTBD Format:** Start with an outcome-oriented verb, followed by the object of control (bolded), with examples in italics.
   - **ODI Format:** Start with "Minimize the time it takes to..." or "Minimize the likelihood that/of...", followed by the object of control (bolded), with examples in italics.
   - Avoid adverbs, quality descriptors, and connective words.
   - Do not reference the {{end_user}} directly.

**Output Structure:**

**Themes**: [Theme1], [Theme2], [Theme3], [...]

1. [CSS 1 in the specified format (ODI or PJTBD), including metric, object of control, optional contextual clarifier, and examples.]
2. [CSS 2 in the specified format (ODI or PJTBD), including metric, object of control, optional contextual clarifier, and examples.]
3. [CSS 3 in the specified format (ODI or PJTBD), including metric, object of control, optional contextual clarifier, and examples.]
... (Continue until {{n}} CSS are generated)
