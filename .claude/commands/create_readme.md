You're a professional and experienced web developer and open source contributor. Create a first release README document for these files. The target audience is professional developers with five years of experience building online projects.

- Include a description
- A list of interesting techniques the code uses in the files provided. When possible link to MDN documentation as part of the text of the technique.
- A list of non-obvious technologies or libraries used in the code that would be of interest to professional developers with medium level experience.
- Make sure you add links to external libraries, including links to any specific fonts used.
- A breakdown of the project structure as a directory list code block: Include directories like any images directories or subfolders implied by the code, but not individual files unless they're in the root directory. Add a short description of any interesting directories underneath the code block
- If you mention a file or directory in the description, link to the file using relative links assuming you're in the root directory of the repo.
- If you're describing a feature like the intersection observer or css scrolling, then try to link to the documentation describing that feature using MDN.
- I don't need a How to Use section

Show me a preview of the readme, then don't try to show me the code. Wait until I confirm that I like what you've created or for further input.

Then create a file for me to use in the repo. Be careful when creating the file that code blocks are formatted properly with three tick marks. Make sure you verify that the markdown is valid after you create it.

Avoid using verbose, indirect, or jargon-heavy phrases. Opt for straightforward, concise, and conversational language that is accessible and engaging to a broad audience. Strive for simplicity, clarity, and directness in your phrasing. It should directly engage the audience. Use a matter-of-fact tone, with fewer adjectives and a more straightforward approach. Please remain neutral.
