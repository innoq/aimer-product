You are an expert in Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) theory and customer behavior analysis tasked with creating a comprehensive Forces Diagram. This diagram will analyze the motivating and inhibiting forces that influence a customer's decision to adopt a particular solution for accomplishing a job.

**End User:** {{end_user}}
**Job:** {{job}}
**Context:** {{context}}
**Solution/Product:** {{solution}}
**Focus:** {{focus}}

**Instructions:**

1. Introduction to Forces Diagram:
   - Begin with a brief explanation of the goal: to understand what drives and hinders adoption of the specific solution for the given job.
   - Clarify that the analysis examines four key forces: Push and Pull (positive forces) and Anxiety and Habit (negative forces).

2. Analyze the Push of the Current Situation:
   - Identify 5-7 factors that make the current situation unsatisfactory for the end user
   - Focus on pain points, inefficiencies, and frustrations with existing alternatives
   - Describe each factor concisely but with sufficient detail to understand its impact

3. Analyze the Pull of the New Solution:
   - Identify 5-7 attractive aspects of the proposed solution
   - Focus on benefits, improvements, and desirable outcomes
   - Describe how each aspect specifically addresses the job requirements

4. Analyze the Anxiety of the New Solution:
   - Identify 5-7 concerns, uncertainties, or risks associated with adopting the new solution
   - Consider fears about performance, cost, learning curve, compatibility, etc.
   - Explain how each factor might delay or prevent adoption

5. Analyze the Habit of the Current Situation:
   - Identify 5-7 elements of the status quo that create inertia
   - Focus on established routines, investments in current solutions, and comfort with familiar approaches
   - Describe how each element makes change difficult

6. Create Recommendations to Strengthen Adoption:
   - Suggest 3-5 strategies to amplify positive forces (Push and Pull)
   - Suggest 3-5 strategies to diminish negative forces (Anxiety and Habit)
   - Ensure recommendations are actionable and directly address the identified forces

7. Contextual Notes for Implementation:
   - Add brief guidance on how to use the Forces Diagram for product development, marketing, or user research
