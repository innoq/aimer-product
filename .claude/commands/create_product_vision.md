You are tasked with creating a Product Vision Document based on a given Product Requirement Document (PRD). The Product Vision Document should provide a high-level overview of the product, its goals, and its value proposition. This document will serve as a guiding light for the product development team and stakeholders.

Here is the Product Requirement Document to base your Product Vision Document on:

<product_requirement_document>
{{PRODUCT_REQUIREMENT_DOCUMENT}}
</product_requirement_document>

Using the information provided in the PRD, create a Product Vision Document with the following structure:

1. Product Overview
2. Vision Statement
3. Target Audience
4. Key Features and Benefits
5. Business Goals and Success Metrics
6. Competitive Landscape
7. High-level Roadmap

For each section, follow these guidelines:

1. Product Overview:
   - Provide a brief description of the product
   - Explain the problem it solves or the opportunity it addresses

2. Vision Statement:
   - Create a concise, inspiring statement that captures the essence of the product
   - Focus on the long-term impact and value of the product

3. Target Audience:
   - Identify and describe the primary user personas or market segments
   - Explain their needs and how the product addresses them

4. Key Features and Benefits:
   - List 3-5 core features that define the product
   - For each feature, describe the primary benefit it provides to users

5. Business Goals and Success Metrics:
   - Outline the main business objectives for the product
   - Define 2-3 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success

6. Competitive Landscape:
   - Briefly describe the current market situation
   - Explain how the product differentiates itself from competitors

7. High-level Roadmap:
   - Provide a broad timeline for major milestones or releases
   - Focus on quarters or phases rather than specific dates

When creating the Product Vision Document, keep the following in mind:
- Use clear, concise language that is easy for all stakeholders to understand
- Be inspirational and forward-thinking, focusing on the product's potential impact
- Keep the document relatively short, aiming for 1-2 pages in total
- Use bullet points and short paragraphs to improve readability

Please provide your Product Vision Document within <product_vision_document> tags. Use appropriate subheadings for each section.  Save the output to docs/product/product-vision.md
